### different
Knowing your audience or in most cases the persona drives data visualization forward. Explore what they already know, questions
that will arise and what new information they intend on gaining. 

For the purposes of getting to know our personas at Ipreo, the best places of reference will be the company persona library (http://UX/personas) or your nearest Product
Owner.

### Becoming a storyteller
Now that you understand the data, know the persona (audience) and understand the questions that they
need answered, there is now a great opportunity for you to tell the story in your visualizations. In many
cases, customized visuals can be designed out, but for the sake of this documentation, we are going to only
focus on perscribed typical graph types.
During your process of storytelling, you will need to think about those persona questions and what the data
says. Does the data give information that allows it to be compared? Does it tell the story of distribution
across the whole amount? Is it data that has information over time? Once you have a good grasp on that,
you can move on to selecting a graph type to use to visualize the data for your personas.
